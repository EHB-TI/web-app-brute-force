# Goal
Our goal is to create a platform for the school, to let the students and teachers carpool safely. 
It will be a web app where you can post your itinerary and people will be able to join you directly from the web app.
The users will be able to choose the rate per KM.
To protect the platform from external people, the users will have to register with their student cards.
To make a profit we will take a commission on every carpooling session, or maybe have some ads displayed on the website.
Our long-term goal is to make the system available to a wider audience. For example, let the VUB implement our platform for their university.

# Acceptance criteria
The goals we have in mind will be reached as soon as we can establish an encrypted and secure link between the students. The users have to be able to schedule a carpool session within a couple of minutes. To make sure the exchange of information is secure, the users have to sign up using their student ID. The whole process has to be as secure and efficient as possible to ensure a good user experience.
## Requirements for good UX
- The input fields during the registration will be auto-filled with the data retrieved using the student ID.
- The user can reuse an old carpooling session to create a new one with the same itinerary and data.
- The users can use a map to pick a location easily.
## Requirements to start a session
- The creator and the other users that take part in the carpooling session need to complete their registration using their student ID.
- The location and time of both the departure and arrival need to be filled in correctly.
- The creator and the users have to agree to the payment method they both wish to use. The two payment methods are PayPal and cash.

# Threat model
*describe your threat model. One or more architectural diagram expected. Also a list of the principal threats and what you will do about them*
# Deployment
*minimally, this section contains a public URL of the app. A description of how your software is deployed is a bonus. Do you do this manually, or did you manage to automate? Have you taken into account the security of your deployment process?*
# *you may want further sections*
*especially if the use of your application is not self-evident*
