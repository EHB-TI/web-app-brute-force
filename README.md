# Goal
Our idea is to create a platform for the school (scalable in the future), to let the students and teachers carpool safely. 
It will be a web app where you can post your itinerary and people will be able to join you directly from the web app.
The users will be able to chose the rate per KM.
To protect the platform from external people, the users will have to register with their student card.
To make profit we will take a commition on every car pooling, or maybe put some ads.
# Acceptance criteria
*how do we know that the goals have been reached?*
# Threat model
*describe your threat model. One or more architectural diagram expected. Also a list of the principal threats and what you will do about them*
# Deployment
*minimally, this section contains a public URL of the app. A description of how your software is deployed is a bonus. Do you do this manually, or did you manage to automate? Have you taken into account the security of your deployment process?*
# *you may want further sections*
*especially if the use of your application is not self-evident*
