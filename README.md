# Goal
Our goal is to create a platform for the school, to let the students and teachers carpool safely. 
It will be a web app where you can post your itinerary and people will be able to join you directly from the web app.
The users will be able to choose the rate per KM.
To protect the platform from external people, the users will have to register with their student card.
To make profit we will take a commition on every car pooling, or maybe have some ads displayed on the website.
Our long term goal is to open the system to a wider public. For example, let the VUB implement our platform for their university.

# Acceptance criteria
The goals we have in mind will be reached as soon as we can establish an encrypted and secure link between the students and that people have to be able to schedule a carpool session within a minute. The users will also be able to register with their strudent ID.
The whole proces has to be as secure and efficient as possible to ensure a good user experience.
## Requirements for good UX
- The input fields during the registration will be auto filled with the data retrieved by the student id.
- The user can reuse an old car pooling session to create a new one with the same itinerary and data.
- The users can use a map to pick a location easily.
## Requirements to start a session
- The creator and the other users that take part to the car pooling have completed their registration with their student ID.
- The departure and arrivale location has to be filled with the pick-up time.
- The creator and the users have to agree for the payment method. The two payment methods are: PayPal and cash.
